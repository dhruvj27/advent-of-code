# Advent of Code

My  solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com), an annual set of 25 Christmas-themed computer programming challenges that follow an Advent calendar.

As [requested](https://adventofcode.com/2024/about#faq_copying) by the challenge creator, I am not copying/committing the puzzle text, inputs or outputs to the repository. 
In general, you should copy the input from `https://adventofcode.com/<year>/day/<day>/input` and paste it into a `input.txt` file in the directory for the respective year and day.
